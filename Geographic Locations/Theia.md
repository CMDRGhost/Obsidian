#### Hill Sphere of the Planets
$$
r_H = a \left( \frac{m_1 + m_2}{3 M_*} \right)^{1/3}
$$
Prograde Orbits are stable if the distance between the two planets doesn't exceed:
$$
a_{in} â‰ˆ 0.5r_H
$$

#### Roche limit

$$
d = R \sqrt[3]{\frac{2p_M}{p_m}}
$$
Thus we have a maximum distance of $R_H$ and a minimum distance of $d$.

#### Star:
Mass: 0.62 $M_{sol}$ (orange dwarf/K5.7V)
Age: 3.28 Gyr (billion years)
Max Age: 41.959 Gyr
Radius: 0.682 $R_{sol}$
Luminosity: 0.148 $L_{sol}$
Density: 1.953 $D_{sol}$
Temperature: 4336K (Hex: \#FFD6B5)
Color: ![Color|30x30](https://convertingcolors.com/plain-FFD6B5.svg)
Habitable zone: 0.367AU - 0.528AU

#### Habitable Planets
Hill Sphere: ca. 917 * 10^6 m
0.5 * Hill Sphere: ca. 458 * 10^6 m
Roche limit: ca. 6.275 * 10^6 m

The planets must have a distance between 458 * 10^6 m and 6.275 * 10^6 m.
The distance earth-moon is 384 * 10^6 m. To decrease the needed travel time a small distance would be useful.
